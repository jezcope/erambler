<p>Someone recently asked me a very interesting question: what two techniques would you use to enable academic staff to make the most of new technology for teaching?</p>

<p>A number of thoughts ran through my mind at this point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ooh, interesting question…</li>
  <li>Hmm, that depends…</li>
  <li>That sounds like a blog post in the making…</li>
  <li>What! Only two?!</li>
</ul>

<p>But I like the idea of narrowing it down to just the two most important; a bit like some weird and geeky version of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnmr">Desert Island Discs</a>. Plus, to keep my analytical side happy, there’s plenty of scope for categorising loads of specific ideas under two broad techniques.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>So, on with the game. After some thought, I think that my two favourite techniques are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Talking to people; and</li>
  <li>Leading by example.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take them one at a time.</p>

<h1 id="talking-to-people">Talking to people</h1>

<p>Well, when I say talking to people, I don’t really mean talking all the time so much as listening. I may not know everything there is to know about technology, but I know more than a little about how it can support teaching; I know plenty about how it’s useful for teaching <em>for me</em>.</p>

<p>But I’m not you. I’m not him over there. And I’m certainly not a busy academic with half a dozen research grants on the go trying to teach my students as best I can alongside the myriad other commitments of life in HE.</p>

<p>And when I say listening, it’s not just about listening. It’s about <em>caring</em>. If I knew the right techniques, I could probably convince you that I was listening, but if I didn’t actually care what you were saying, you’d probably guess pretty quickly.</p>

<p>I don’t know much about neurolinguistic programming or anything like that, but what I do know is that when I take a genuine interest in what someone’s saying then I really get a lot out of it. That’s not something you can fake, but I’ve found that you can actively take an interest in pretty much anything or anyone if you make a bit of effort.</p>

<p>Why is this important? The only way I can help you (or him over there) to make the best of technology is to get a clear picture of what your needs are. I need to <em>understand</em> you. It’s no use me patronising you with information you already know; neither is it helpful to force-feed you information that you just have no use for.</p>

<p>Only if I understand your unique situation can I provide the advice that will help you improve your teaching, or leave well alone if that’s the best option.</p>

<h1 id="teaching-by-example">Teaching by example</h1>

<p>This is something I try to do all the time, in everything I do. I won’t claim that I succeed all of the time, but I’m getting better at it the more I do.</p>

<p>A little while back I read Postman &amp; Weingartner’s <em>Teaching as a Subversive Activity</em> (and I recommend you do to if you’re interested in improving the quality of education). One of the big messages I took away from it was that <em>we learn what we do</em>.</p>

<p>In other words, <em>how</em> we teach (and thus how students learn) is just as important, if not more so, than <em>what</em> we teach.</p>

<p>So, if I want to help you understand how technology can improve your teaching and make life easier for both you and your students (“Why should we make life easy on our students?” I hear them cry) it won’t help if I stand up in front you and your colleagues and give a 45 minute death-by-Powerpoint presentation on how to use Facebook.</p>

<p>Instead (and having listened to you I’ll have an idea of what fits the way you work) I’ll use a whole range of techniques. By giving you a 2-minute online video of tips on how to facilitate online discussions, I can show you how effective YouTube is for teaching. By encouraging you to take part in an online discussion about teaching with video, I can help you see what does and doesn’t help people learn from forums. I might even give you a 45-minute presentation on the theoretical pedagogies of Facebook, if that’s what works for you.</p>

<p>This technique does at least two useful things. First, it gives you an opportunity to get first-hand experience of what tools are out there and what they’re like to use. Secondly, it demonstrates that when it comes to e-learning I have a good enough idea of what’s going on to give you advice that you can trust.</p>

<h1 id="in-the-end">In the end…</h1>

<p>…it mostly comes down to trust. If you trust that I both care about you (and your students) and know what I’m talking about, how much more likely are you to consider listening to me?</p>
