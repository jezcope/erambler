Welcome to my shiny new* blog! I've decided it's about time I gave the world the benefit of my fascinating and wise opinions. In an attempt to place realistic limits on myself, I shall in particular be writing on the subjects of:
<ul>
	<li>My <a title="My university webpage" href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~jeremy/">research</a></li>
	<li>Teaching and learning in higher education</li>
	<li>Productivity in academia</li>
	<li>The use of the internet in all of the above</li>
</ul>
I hope you find what I have to say interesting enough to follow me on a regular basis; if you'd like to do so, please consider subscribing to my RSS feed and/or bookmarking this site. Feedback in the form of comments on blog entries is positively encouraged.

Enjoy...
