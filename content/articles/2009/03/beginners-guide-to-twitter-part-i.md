Iâ€™ve recently signed up to <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. Itâ€™s not a new thing; itâ€™s been around for a few years and itâ€™s probably safe to say that Iâ€™m way behind the curve on this one. For those who havenâ€™t come across it yet, itâ€™s a very, <em>very</em> simple social networking site which allows you to broadcast 140-character messages. However, in spite of this simplicity, itâ€™s a very powerful tool, and can be quite off-putting for new users.

Since Iâ€™m a bit techie and tend to pick these things up quite quickly, a few friends have suggested that I lay down some words on how to get to grips with Twitter. Iâ€™ve ended up breaking it into three to make it a bit more digestible:

</ol>
Iâ€™ll spread them out by publishing them over a period of three days. So, without further ado, hereâ€™s the first part of my guide to making this very cool tool work for you.

<h1>How does it work?</h1>
When I said it was simple, I wasnâ€™t kidding. Once youâ€™ve signed up on the Twitter website, you do one of three things: send and receive messages, follow people (more on what this means in a bit), or search through the archive of old messages. Thatâ€™s it. Letâ€™s have a look at those components in more detail.
<h2>Messages</h2>
The core of Twitter is the status update or tweet; thatâ€™s a brief message, broadcast to every other user, taking up no more than 140 characters (letters, digits, punctuation, spaces). By and large, this will be some form of answer to the question â€œWhat are you doing?â€ You can send as many of these as you like, whenever you like. You can even split a longer message across several tweets (manually), but if you need to do this, you might want to question whether another medium might be more appropriate.

You can also send direct messages to specific users: these are completely private one-to-one communications. If youâ€™re having a conversation publicly with another user and itâ€™s starting to ramble on, think about switching to direct messages to avoid subjecting everyone else to a conversation that doesnâ€™t concern them. You can only send direct messages to users who are following you: more on what this means next.
<h2>Followers</h2>
Wading through the tweets of every other twitterer on the planet is going to take some time. The answer to this problem is â€˜followingâ€™. Youâ€™ll notice that, to begin with, your home page shows only your own tweets. No, Twitter isnâ€™t broken: this page will only show the tweets of people youâ€™re following.

This hands control over what you read back to you: you donâ€™t have to follow anyone you donâ€™t want to. I canâ€™t emphasise enough how important this is: <em>donâ€™t follow anyone whose tweets arenâ€™t worth reading</em>. By all means follow someone for a while before you make this decision, and change your mind all you want. Just remember that if youâ€™re not interested in updates on userxyzâ€™s cat at 90-second intervals, no-one says you have to follow them.

You can follow someone by visiting their profile page, which will have the form â€œhttp://twitter.com/<em>username</em>â€. This page lists their most recent tweets, newest first. Right at the top, underneath their picture, thereâ€™s a button marked â€œFollowâ€: click this and itâ€™ll change to a message telling you that youâ€™re now following them. To stop following someone, click this message and itâ€™ll reveal a â€œRemoveâ€ button for you to press. Twitter will send them an email when you start following them, but not when you stop.

<div class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-156" src="http://allacademic.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/following.png" alt="Following info" width="500" height="200" /><p>Following info</p></div>

On the left of your home page, there are links entitled â€œFollowingâ€ and â€œFollowersâ€ which take you to a list of people you follow and people who follow you, respectively. On your followers list, youâ€™ll see a tick next to anyone youâ€™re also following, and a follow button next to anyone youâ€™re not. Following people who follow you is good for at least three reasons:
<ol>
	<li>It allows you to hold a conversation, and to receive direct messages from them;</li>
	<li>Itâ€™s a great way to build your network;</li>
	<li>Itâ€™s considered polite.</li>
</ol>
That said, my previous advice still stands: you donâ€™t have to follow anyone you donâ€™t want to.

So how do you find people to follow? Youâ€™ve got a few options here. The best way to get started is to follow people you know in real life: try searching for them. As Iâ€™ve already mentioned you can follow people who follow you. You can wade through the global list of tweets and follow people with similar interests (searching will help here: see the next section). You could have a look at the <a href="http://wefollow.com/">we follow directory</a> to find people. Finally, you can explore your network by looking at your followersâ€™ followers and so on.

Itâ€™s worth reiterating at this point that all your tweets are visible, ultimately, to anyone on the network. If youâ€™re not happy with this, you can restrict access, which means that only your followers can read your tweets. Itâ€™ll also mean that you have to give your approval before someone can follow you. This might work for you, but openness has itâ€™s benefits: youâ€™ll find it a lot more people will follow you if you keep your account open. Youâ€™ll get a lot more out of Twitter if you stay open and simply avoid saying anything that you donâ€™t want the whole world to know.
<h2>Search</h2>
So, youâ€™ve got to grips with sending and reading tweets, youâ€™ve chosen a few people to follow and started to join in the global conversation that is Twitter. Youâ€™re already getting a lot out of this great tool. But what about all the tweets youâ€™re missing?

Perhaps you represent a company and want to know whoâ€™s talking about your brand. Maybe youâ€™re going to attend a conference and want to connect with other delegates. Maybe you just want the answer to a question and want to see if someoneâ€™s already mentioned it.

For these, and many more, problems, Twitter search is the answer. Try searching for a brand, a conference or anything else youâ€™re interested in, and youâ€™ll quickly and easily discover what twitterers the world over are saying about it. You might even want to follow some of them.

Well, that's it for today. Tomorrow I'll be looking at some of the initially confusing but massively useful conventions that have grown up within Twitter: @replies, #hashtags and retweeting.

I want to bring you really high quality stuff, and the only way I do that is if you (yes, you with the web browser) tell me how Iâ€™m doing. Please leave a comment below or link to me from your own blog (thatâ€™ll appear here as a comment too, with a link back to you: free publicity!). Iâ€™ll do my best to respond to feedback, correct inaccuracies in the text and write more about things that interest both me and you. Finally, if you find this post useful please tell your friends and colleagues. Thanks for stopping by!</em>
