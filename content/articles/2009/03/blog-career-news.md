Hello loyal readers! I thought you might like to know where this blog will be going over the next few years, so I'm announcing that I've taken a decision to pursue a career in training and development, with a focus on e-learning. I'll continue to blog about the bluecloud project, but I'll also be writing about more general e-learning topics that I think you might find interesting and reflecting on my experience of making the transition to my new career. I've updated the about page on this site to give a bit more professional info about myself.

If you've got any advice for a new e-learning professional, or would like to contact me for any other reason, please leave a comment here or follow me on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/jezcope">@jezcope</a>).
