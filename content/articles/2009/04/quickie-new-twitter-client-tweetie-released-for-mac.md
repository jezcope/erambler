<p style="clear:both"><a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/" class="image-link"><img src="http://allacademic.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/atebits-tweetie-for-mac-thumb.png" height="229" align="right" width="214" style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px" /></a>I've been playing with Twitter for a couple of months now, and I have to say, I rather like it. I've graduated from interacting with it purely through <a href="http://twitter.com/">the Twitter site</a>, and tend to use a client for most of my tweeting.</p><p style="clear:both">On my iPod touch, I've been using a client by the name of <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-iphone/">Tweetie</a> from an indie developer by the name of <a href="http://www.atebits.com/">atebits</a>, which has loads of great features that I won't bore you with here. Today it was announced (<a href="http://twitter.com/atebits/status/1564541335">via Twitter, of course</a>) that the <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/">Mac version is ready for human consumption</a>.</p><p style="clear:both">I've switched over to it as my primary Twitter client already and I have to say I really like it. It's still got some rough edges and it's missing some useful functionality that I liked in <a href="http://www.nambu.com/">Nambu</a>, but it's already showing the great attention to detail and some of the range of features that have made the iPhone/iPod touch version so good. There are already some detailed reviews up, from <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/12/17/tweetie-twitter-client-with-oomph/">The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/20/tweetie-for-mac-a-powerful-native-twitter-client-for-the-masses/">TechCrunch</a>, so I'll leave it at that, but if you're a Mac twitterer and you haven't already, I strongly recommend you give it a try.</p><p style="clear:both"><em>I'm also testing out another bit of software right now: a Mac blogging client by the name of <a href="http://www.drinkbrainjuice.com/blogo">Blogo</a>. This is my first post using it, and I'll let you know how I get on with it.<br /></em></p><p style="clear:both"><em>In the meantime, how do you access Twitter? Or perhaps you dont?
