I often come across links that I find useful or enjoyable and that I'd like to share, but that I haven't got time to write a full blog post about. I've decided, therefore, to try wrapping a few of my favourites up into a weekly(ish) digest which I'll post here.

This week, a selection of Twitter-related links:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://hootsuite.com/">HootSuite</a> â€” Describing itself as "the ultimate Twitter toolbox", HootSuite lets you manage multiple Twitter accounts, have multiple users on one account (without revealing the password for that account), schedule tweets and much more.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.twitip.com">TwiTip</a> â€” A blog filled to the brim with helpful Twitter advice and tips.</li>
	<li><a href="http://wthashtag.com/wiki/Main_Page">What the Hashtag?!</a> â€” A user-written encyclopaedia of hashtags: great for figuring out the meaning of that cryptic hashtag you've just found in your Twitter stream.</li>
	<li><a class="fn url" title="Permanent Link to 13 â€œTwitsâ€ Who Will Change Your Perspective on Reality" rel="bookmark" href="http://mashable.com/2009/04/14/twitter-science/">13 â€œTwitsâ€ Who Will Change Your Perspective on Reality</a> â€” A list of Twitter users who are well worth following.</li>

</ul>
You can also get an idea of what I've been reading and doing from:
