I'm coming up to the end of the PCHE course, so I thought I'd give over this month's blog posts to some reflection on what I've learnt over the two years I've been studying it. I'll be mixing up some shorter and longer posts and aiming to prompt some discussion about the wide variety of issues affecting modern education, incorporating as much of my own experience as I can shoehorn in. I expect to get at least as many things wrong as I get right: I hope you'll join us for a good argument! <br />&nbsp;<br />I'll also be experimenting with some different methods of posting â€” I'm posting this, for example, by email via my Posterous account (<a href="http://jezcope.posterous.com/)">http://jezcope.posterous.com/)</a>. I'll let you know how that gets on too. <br />&nbsp;<br />Have any topics you'd particularly like to read my opinion on? Please let me know in the comments below.
