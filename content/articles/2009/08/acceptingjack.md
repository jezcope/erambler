I've got Radio 4 on while I do the washing up, and I'm listening to [It's My Story: Accepting Jack - Six Years On][Accepting Jack]. It follows a number of families with kids who have special needs, and about 20 minutes in, there's a wonderful moment when a sibling is describing the benefits of having a brother with disabilities. In between not having to walk far to school and getting to skip the queue at the theme park, this young boy announces that he's had "a lot of learning experiences", having had to learn sign language which he might need later in life.

Kids have a natural ability and desire to learn, and given the opportunity they can understand this and grow. How can we keep that going into adulthood?
