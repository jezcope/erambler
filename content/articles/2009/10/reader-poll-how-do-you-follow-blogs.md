I have several reasons for writing this post. Chief among them is curiosity: I like pulling the universe to bits and poking it to see what happens, and I'm genuinely interested in finding out how readers of this blog actually keep up to date with the blogosphere. Second, I've spent a lot of time in academia, where evidence is a key part of life; I'm aware that a lot of what I say on here is just my opinion so it'll be nice to make a change to that (self-selecting samples aside). Third, it's useful from a promotion perspective to know how people are getting here: [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com/) and [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/) stats only tell part of the story. Finally, the [PollDaddy](http://polldaddy.com/) plugin for Wordpress has been around for a while now and I really want to try it out.

**Update 17 May 2015:** I'm doing some cleanup and this poll is no longer accessible.
