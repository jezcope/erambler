So, in case any of my regular readers (do I have any?) have been wondering why there hasn't been a lot to read regularly, I thought I'd post a short update to let you all know what I've been up to: planning a wedding and starting a business, in between commuting to my part-time job tutoring kids. It's all been *loads* of fun (and will continue to be) and I've not really had time to make blog posts.

More posts, when I get back from the honeymoon. Bye for now!
