I've just discovered a great piece of reference management software called [Mendeley][]. I've heard it mentioned a bit recently, by people like [Brian Kelly][], [Peter Murray-Rust][] and [Jean-Claude Bradley][], but when my wife mentioned it after her recent visit to the [ILI2010 (Internet Library International)][ILI2010] conference I finally thought I'd give it a go.

Keeping your references together is an ongoing problem for any researcher. For years the standard software has been Endnote, though I've never used it much myself[^1]. [BibDesk][] has been my tool of choice for the last few years, but I can't recommend it to many people because it's Mac-only, as is the beautifully-designed but paid-for [Papers][]. More recently, I've found [Zotero][] very useful, but it's only available as a plugin for Firefox. 

And whatever tool you use, keeping it in sync between multiple computers is a pain for anyone who doesn't have a good grasp of version control software. There have been some online tools like [Connotea][], but mostly they felt a bit clunky, and had no integration with any kind of word processing tool.

[^1]: Mostly because I used [LaTeX][], [BibTeX][] and [Pybliographer][] as an undergraduate, and endlessly exporting BibTeX files from another system seemed a bit klunky.

I've not played with Mendeley for long yet, but it feels different: <del>it's open-source</del> <ins cite="http://erambler.co.uk/2010/10/17/mendeley-open-bibliography-for-everyone/comment-page-1/#comment-222">(**Correction**: it's free, has an open API and the catalog is Creative-Commons licensed)</ins>; it's cross-platform; it's a desktop app but syncs between computers via a web tool.

The online version isn't just for syncing though: it adds real value. There are social networking features, so you can discover new references based on what your contacts are reading. It's also building up a free and open bibliographic database, like [Web of Knowledge][] or [Scopus][] but without the price-tag, and with statistics on how many people are reading the articles.

I'll certainly be using it myself for a while and recommending it to our students to try. Anyone else tried it out yet?
