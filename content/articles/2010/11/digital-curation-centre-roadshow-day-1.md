Today saw the first day of the Digital Curation Centre's (DCC) 3-day workshop on data management here in Bath. Today was just a half-day and gave a general overview of the data management landscape.

My aims for the event are to better understand how I can teach our doctoral students about good data management, and provide them with the right tools to do it in practice.

I'll be looking out for:

* Examples of good practice from people who are already doing this with their students;
* Ways of making data management easy (nay even attractive) for researchers who would not otherwise be interested;
* Advice on how to assess the data needs of researchers and select appropriate methods of storing and archiving that data.

We had an excellent strategic overview from Liz Lyon (Director of [UKOLN][]), followed by three case studies presented by Chris McMahon (University of Bath), Gregory Tourte (University of Bristol) and Kenji Takeda (University of Southampton). The afternoon closed with a short talk from the DCC's director, Kevin Ashley, on what [resources the DCC provides to support people in rolling out good data management practice][DCC resources].

I've been promised that the slides will be available on the web soon, so I'll post those as soon as I know where they are. There also seem to be a few twitterers there so I've saved the [twitter stream from the event][Twitter stream] for future reference, and if you want to follow it live the hashtag is #dccsw10.

Tomorrow's session is a little bit high-level for me, being aimed at senior management and similar roles, but I'll be attending both of the more practical workshops on Thursday.
