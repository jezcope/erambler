As I've grown older, I've gradually made more conscious attempts to think about what I want my life to be like. Like most people, I'm typically rubbish at either making or keeping New Year's resolutions, so this year I'm following David Seah's [Groundhog Day Resolutions][] pattern.

The idea is to start thinking about the resolutions around Christmas and actually commit to them on the 2nd of February (2/2) and then review them on 3rd March (3/3), 4th April (4/4) etc. I'm not making these solid commitments, but things that I want to track my progress against. It's ok to let one or two go if I don't have the time — I'm not Superman after all.

I hope that by publishing this that I'm more likely to follow through on the process, and that it will prompt others to do the same.

# Do more #

* Blogging;
  - My strategy here is to write shorter posts — this one is an example;
* Playing [Go][];
* [Photography][];
* Running (10k target time 50 minutes);
* Walking with Elly and friends;
* Playing music, at home and socially.

# Do less #

* Watching crap telly;
* Avoiding things that are important but not urgent (housework, taxes, etc.).

# Keep the same #

* Kicking ass at work;
* Meeting new and interesting people;
* [Morris dancing][].
