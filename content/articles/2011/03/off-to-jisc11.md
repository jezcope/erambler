Right now I'm on a train on my way to Liverpool for the annual [JISC Conference][] there. There are a few small things going on this afternoon, but the main event doesn't start til tomorrow.

[JISC conference]: http://www.jisc.ac.uk/events/2011/03/jisc11

There are loads of interesting sessions going on, but I've narrowed it down to these three based on the abstracts:

- Cloud Solutions: risk or reward?
- Open scholarship
- Amplified Events, Seminars, Conferences: What? Why? How?

If you'll be there too, please come and introduce yourself --- it's my first JISC conference and it's always nice to meet new people. I'll be blogging and tweeting for anyone who's interested (so apologies in advance to anyone who doesn't care: it's only for one day).
