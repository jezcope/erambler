As part of my ongoing efforts to introduce a virtual research environment to the <abbr title="Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies">CSCT</abbr>, I've been thinking about running a general [Digital Researcher][] type workshop for our students. After putting out feelers I discovered that quite a few other people across the university are thinking about similar things right now, so we're working together to avoid duplication as much as we can.

I think it's important to focus on things that researchers actually want to do, rather than just thinking about the technologies. So far, based on my own experiences and conversations with one or two research students, I've come up with the following list of goals:

* Promote my research;
* Communicate with existing collaborators;
* Find potential new collaborators;
* Find reliable information on X (including recognised experts);
* Keep up to date with news & opportunities;
* Find my next job.

What do you think? Is there anything missing?
