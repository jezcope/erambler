Well here it is: the new look. I hope you like it. I've decided to publish it
with the minimum possible functionality so that I can start publishing with it
straight away, and I'll be adding a few features here and there over the next
few weeks.

I've aimed to make the look as simple and clean as possible so that there's
just you, me and the content.

As I write this, I haven't yet decided whether or not to have comments enabled
before I publish it, but if not then they'll be here soon. All
comments/feedback/flames welcome!
