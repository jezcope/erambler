Well here it is: the new look. I hope you like it. I've decided to publish it
with the minimum possible functionality so that I can start publishing with it
straight away, and I'll be adding a few features here and there over the next
few weeks.

I've aimed to make the look as simple and clean as possible so that there's
just you, me and the content. It really still needs a splash of colour, and
there are a few other little features that I'd like to add, but otherwise this
is the new eRambler.

By the way, I apologise if the changes to the RSS feed mean that you get a lot
of old posts in your RSS reader. This should only happen once.

As I write this, I haven't yet decided whether or not to have comments enabled
before I publish it, but if not then they'll be here soon. All
comments/feedback/flames welcome!
