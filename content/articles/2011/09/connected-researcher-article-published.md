It's been available for a few weeks now, but I just thought I'd draw some
attention to the fact that my [article with Geraldine Jones from Humanities &
Social Sciences about our Connected Researcher at Bath project][article] has
now been published in [UKOLN][]'s web magazine for information professionals,
[Ariadne][].

In case you haven't read my [earlier post](/blog/connected-researcher-at-bath/)
on the subject, this was a series of workshops we've run (and are hoping to run
again next year) encouraging postgraduate research students to try out new
media tools and think about how they could support their research and careers.
We ran workshops on:

-   Twitter;
-   Feed readers;
-   Blogging; and
-   Social bookmarking.

Printable versions (Word and PDF) are available from [our institutional repository,
Opus][printable].
