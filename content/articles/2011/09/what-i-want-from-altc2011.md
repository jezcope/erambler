I've been looking over the programme for ALT-C to try and decide which bits I want to attend, so I thought I'd write a short post about what I want to get from the conference.

I'm currently interested in the following:

*   Research student development;
*   Virtual Research Environments;
*   Open scholarship;
*   Digital literacy;
*   Cloud computing;
*   Generally any overlap between teaching and research, especially in STEM subjects.

As well as attending plenty of interesting talks, I'm also looking forward to meeting lots of new people too! Feel free to come and say hi if you see me --- you can see what I look like from the photo on [my work homepage](http://people.bath.ac.uk/jc619).

As an aside, this is also the first test of my mobile posting process for the new site...
