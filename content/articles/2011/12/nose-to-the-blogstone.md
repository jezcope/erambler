Well, I'm just back from the launch meeting of the JISC Managing Research Data
programme, of which our [Research360 project at Bath][] is a part, and coming
to terms with the fact that blogging is now an inescapable part of my job.

Looks like it's time to get back into my blogging rhythm once more. Time to
make a few tweaks that I've been planning to the layout too. Let me know what
