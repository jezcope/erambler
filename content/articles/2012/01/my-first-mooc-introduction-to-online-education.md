I've decided to sign up and join [David Wiley's MOOC, Introduction to Open
Education 2012](http://openeducation.us/). A [MOOC (Massively Open Online
Course)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooc) is an online course, typically run
by a lecturer at a university, which is freely accessible and built around the
ideas of connectivism and social learning.

The content of the course, which is about the various 'kinds' of openness
currently practised in higher education, fits nicely with what I'm doing at the
moment so I thought I'd give it a try.

Although I could theoretically find, study and blog about all of the content in
this course on my own, I think that the social aspect and the defined set of
objectives (in the form of "badges") combined make it more likely that I will
follow through.

Let's see if that's actually true...
