Well, I've arrived in Manchester for ALT-C 2012, registered and checked into my room. Tomorrow Cathy Pink and I will be talking about [using research data for teaching](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/news/get/2012/09/10/exploiting-research-data-for-teaching-at-alt-c-2012/).

Leave a comment here or contact me via Twitter if you'd like to meet up â€” I'm here for the whole conference, and hopefully blogging as I go along.
