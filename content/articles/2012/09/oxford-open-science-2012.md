On Wednesday 22 August 2012, I gave an invited presentation at the August meeting of Oxford Open Science, hosted at the Oxford e-Research Centre. The theme of the evening was "How do we prepare postgraduate research student for the era of big data?"

There were some interesting presentations around that subject:

* Juliet Ralph and Oliver Bridle from the [Bodleian](http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/bodley) discussed information seeking behaviour amongst students;
* [Open Knowledge Foundation's](http://okfn.org/) Laura Newman told us about the [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/), a project to produce learning resources for those working with data;
* Anna Collins from [DSpace Cambridge](http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/) talked about "long tail in the shadow of big data".

My own presentation discussed some of the work I've done providing social media and data management training for PGRs, and the slides can be viewed here:

As an experiment, the [LaTeX source of the slides](http://github.com/jezcope/oxford-open-science-2012) is also available on github. Let me know if they're any use.
