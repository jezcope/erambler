It's October, which means the autumn TV season has started, which means that [Strictly Come Dancing][] is back on for another year, which means it's time for a flurry of blog posts as I leave my wonderful other half to shout at the TV on weekend evenings.

I've decided to have another go at joining in with another [MOOC][] to give me some blog fuel, and this time round it's [Current & Future State of Higher Education 2012][CFHE12]. 

My last MOOC attempt, [IOE12][], sort of fizzled out (my participation, not the course itself) as I didn't really have the time to keep it going. Hopefully I'll do better this time, but if not I'm sure I'll learn something anyway.

So, hello fellow MOOCers and watch this space!
