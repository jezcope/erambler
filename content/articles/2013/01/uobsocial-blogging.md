Here are a few links to things that I mentioned (and maybe a few that I didn't) in today's briefing session for University of Bath researchers. Please feel free to leave your own suggestions, or links to your own blog, in the comments at the bottom.

## Reading blogs

Once you start following more than two or three blogs, you might find it easier to use a piece of software called a "feed reader" or "news aggregator" (or other similar terms) to do the hard work and collect all the new posts in one place. Here are a few options:

-   [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com/) — web based
-   [FeedDemon](http://www.feeddemon.com/) — Windows (optional sync with Google Reader)
-   [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) — Mac, iOS (Google Reader account required)
-   [Feedly](http://feedly.com/) — Browser plugin, iOS, Android (Google Reader account required)
-   All major web browsers now have some sort of feed reader built in too

[Technorati](http://technorati.com/blogs/directory/) and [Google Blog Search](http://www.google.com/blogsearch) are good ways to find something to read.

## Ways to blog

### Hosted

The simplest way to start a blog is to use a service (free or paid-for) which handles everything for you. Here are some examples:

-   [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/)
-   [University of Bath blogs](http://blogs.bath.ac.uk/)
-   [Blogger](http://blogger.com/)
-   [Typepad](http://typepad.com/)

### Self-hosted

If you're a bit more technical and/or demanding, you may prefer to host your own blog on a server. Here are some examples of software that will help:

-   [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/)
-   [Movable Type](http://movabletype.org/)
-   [Drupal](http://drupal.org/)

## Other tips

-   Create an [about page](/about/) to explain who you are
-   Use [ifttt ("if that then this")](https://ifttt.com/) to push blog posts out to other social media
-   And always remember: [don't feed the trolls!](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Don%27t_feed_the_Troll)
