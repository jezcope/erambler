This year, I've decided to make a project of working through the winners of the [Hugo Award for Best Novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_award_for_best_novel).  The Hugos are one of the biggest English-language science fiction and fantasy awards going.  Late last year, I came across the list looking to broaden my reading (I tend to fixate on individual authors and devour entire canons of work before moving on) and realised I'd already read quite a few, and there were quite a few more that I had my eye on to read soon.

I've already been distracted by the epic [Great Book of Amber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Amber_%28omnibus%29) (all 10 of Robert Zelazny's Amber novels in a single mighty volume --- I've wanted to read it for ages and I got it for Christmas), but I'm enjoying the variety.  So far, I've read Kim Stanley Robinson's Green Mars and Blue Mars, having started the [Mars trilogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy) before Christmas, and Zelazny's classic [Lord of Light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_light) (watch out for The Pun!), and I'm currently enjoying [The Left Hand of Darkness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_hand_of_darkness) by Ursula K. Le Guin.
