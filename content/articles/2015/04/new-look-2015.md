If you're viewing this on the web, you might notice there have been a few changes round here: I've updated my theme to be more responsive and easier to read on different screen sizes.  It's been interesting learning how to use the [Bootstrap][] CSS framework, originally developed by Twitter to make putting together responsive sites with a fixed or fluid grid layout straightforward.

I don't have the means to test it on every possible combination of browsers and devices, so please let me know if you notice anything weird-looking!
