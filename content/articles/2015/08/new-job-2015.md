It's been a bit hectic lately because I've been finishing up my old job (at Imperial College) and getting started on my new one (Research Data Manager at the University of Sheffield), with a bit of a holiday in between. Hopefully things will calm down a bit now and get back to normal (whatever *that* looks like...).

In the meantime here are three things I will miss from Imperial:

- Lovely, friendly, supportive, competent and professional colleagues
- Lunchtime walks in Hyde Park
- Imperial College Scifi & Fantasy library (part of the Students' Union)

And three things I *won't* miss:

- Rude people & overcrowding on the tube/bus/etc
- Masses of air and noise pollution
- Travelling between Leeds & London all the time

And finally, three things I'm looking forward to in Sheffield:

- Taking up a new challenge with a new set of disciplines to work with
- Catching up with old friends and making a few new ones
- Lunchtime walks in Weston Park, Crookes Valley Park & the Ponderosa
