I help people in Higher Education communicate and collaborate more effectively using technology.  I currently work at the [University of Sheffield][] focusing on [research data management][] policy, practice, training and advocacy.

In my free time, I like to: run; play the accordion; [morris dance][]; climb; cook; read (fiction and non-fiction); write.
