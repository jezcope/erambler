A couple of months ago,
I went to Oxford for an intensive, 2-day course
run by [Software Carpentry][SWC] and [Data Carpentry][DC]
for prospective new instructors.

I've now had confirmation that I've completed the checkout procedure so it's official:
I'm now a certified [Data Carpentry instructor][]!
As far as I'm aware, the certification process is now combined,
so I'm also approved to teach Software Carpentry material too.
And of course there's [Library Carpentry][LC] too...
