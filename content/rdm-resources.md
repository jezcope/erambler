I occasionally get asked for resources to help someone learn more about research data management (RDM) as a discipline (i.e. for those providing RDM support rather than simply wanting to manage their own data).  I've therefore collected a few resources together on this page.  If you're lucky I might even update it from time to time!

First, a caveat: this is very focussed on UK Higher Education, though much of it will still be relevant for people outside that narrow demographic.

My general recommendation would be to start with the [Digital Curation Centre (DCC)](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/) website and follow links out from there. I also have a slowly growing [list of RDM links on Diigo](https://www.diigo.com/outliner/11flkb/Research-data-management?key=mzirvjs7rt), and there's an RDM section in my [list of blogs and feeds](/blogroll/) too.

## Mailing lists

- [Jiscmail](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/) is a popular list server run for the benefit of further and higher education in the UK; the following lists are particularly relevant:
    - RESEARCH-DATAMAN
    - DATA-PUBLICATION
    - DIGITAL-PRESERVATION
    - LIS-RESEARCHSUPPORT
 - The [Research Data Alliance](https://rd-alliance.org/groups) have a number of Interest Groups and Working Groups that discuss issues by email 

## Events
 
- [International Digital Curation Conference](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/international-digital-curation-conference-idcc) — major annual conference
- [Research Data Management Forum](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/research-data-management-forum-rdmf) — roughly every six months, places are limited!
- [RDA Plenary](https://rd-alliance.org/plenary-meetings.html) — also every 6 months, but only about 1 in every 3 in Europe
