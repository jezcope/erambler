Continuing with the task I began yesterday, here are my initial thoughts on<br>
today’s talks and workshops at ALT-C 2011.</p>

<h2 id="social-media-and-professional-identity">Social media and professional identity</h2>

<p>I began the day with <a href="http://wishfulthinkinginmedicaleducation.blogspot.com/">Anne-Marie<br>
Cunningham’s</a> talk on<br>
professional identity in the context of medical education. Anne-Marie herself<br>
has a complex identity, as practitioner, educator, researcher and student, and<br>
when she began blogging and tweeting in order to combat the isolation she<br>
sometimes felt as a GP she found that identity challenged in some interesting<br>
ways.</p>

<p>Following Anne-Marie’s talk was a poorly disguised sales pitch from some guy<br>
who works for Blackboard — the least said about that the better, I think.</p>

<h2 id="led-by-the-knows">Led by the “Knows”</h2>

<p>Next up, <a href="http://about.me/dajbelshaw">Doug Belshaw</a> and <a href="http://home.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1990/">John<br>
Traxler</a> gave me a refreshing change: a<br>
workshop which was actually a workshop. They’d chosen a couple of collections<br>
of elearning-related case-studies, and split us into groups to critically<br>
analyse the case-studies therein. We got a really good debate going, trying to<br>
decide what the purpose of a case study should be and what it should contain to<br>
be valid/useful.</p>

<p>For my part, I think that a lot of the weaknesses we identified could be<br>
mitigated by the inclusion of references to the sources of the data quoted, so<br>
that if you choose you can verify the conclusions for yourself.</p>

<p>I did like John Traxler’s comment that we need to be wary of policy-based<br>
evidence replacing evidence-based policy.</p>

<h2 id="are-we-in-open-country">Are we in Open Country?</h2>

<p>The last session before lunch was a bit of fun, but with a serious message too.<br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ambrouk">Amber Thomas</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/daveowhite">David<br>
White</a>, <a href="http://followersoftheapocalyp.se/">David<br>
Kernohan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Helenbeetham">Helen<br>
Beetham</a> got dressed up as characters from<br>
the Wild West to talk about issues related to OER. There was even bonus banjo<br>
music from Dave Kernohan!</p>

<p>Some of the most interesting points for me came up in the extended discussion<br>
that followed their introductory presentation. In particular, it’s very<br>
important when thinking about OER to not get sidetracked by the content. Making<br>
content open has some value, but it does not democratise access to education<br>
<em>per se</em>; in some ways it can have the opposite effect. It’s important to<br>
be able to associate the pedagogical context with a given open resource.<br>
Similar arguments seem to apply to other forms of openness as well.</p>

<h2 id="transforming-american-education">Transforming American Education</h2>

<p>After lunch we had a keynote speech from <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/news/staff/bios/cator.html">Karen<br>
Cator</a>, Director of the Office<br>
of Educational Technology at the U.S. Department of Education. She told us a<br>
bit about the Obama government’s plans for educational technology, which does<br>
indeed sound quite impressive!</p>

<p>She described technology as a “force multiplier” — not a replacement for<br>
teachers but a way of making teachers more effective, which I think is the<br>
only attitude that can work in the long term. As part of that, they’re making<br>
an effort to make educational research more transparent and accessible to<br>
educators so that they have more opportunities to learn about<br>
evidence-supported good practice.</p>

<p>She also talked about making learning more like a game, something which I’m<br>
currently a bit sceptical about. I can see the advantages, but there’s always<br>
the danger that as you incentivise one group you end up disincentivising or<br>
even alienating another. It has to be implemented in a sufficiently fool-proof<br>
way to avoid that situation occurring.</p>

<h2 id="effective-web-conferencing">Effective web conferencing</h2>

<p>My final session of the day was a workshop on web conferencing with a guy from<br>
<a href="http://www.collab8.com/">collaborATE</a>, who provide support for Adobe Connect<br>
in the UK. I’ll admit, I was a bit wary of this after the earlier Blackboard<br>
sales pitch, but actually the presenter did a great job of providing us with<br>
some useful tips for running a successful webcast.</p>

<p>I took a lot of notes from this session, so I’ll probably save them for another<br>
post, perhaps when I’ve had chance to try them out. The key message, though,<br>
was this: <em>preparation, preparation, preparation</em>. Like all forms of<br>
communication, webcasting works best when you’re confident, well practiced and<br>
in control of your environment.</p>

<p>In a little bit it will be time to relax a bit and have a good old chinwag with<br>
some old and new friends at the gala buffet, so I’ll wrap it up for now.</p>

<p>PS. If you’re wondering where all my tweets about the conference have gone, I’m<br>
experimenting with a separate conference account,<br>
<a href="http://twitter.com/jezconf">@jezconf</a> to avoid spamming my regular followers<br>
with lots of ALT-C tweets. If you’re interested, please follow that account, or<br>
you can just follow the conference hashtag,<br>
