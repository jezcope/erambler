I’ve now had my <a href="http://amazon.com/kindle">Kindle</a> for just over 12 months — it<br>
was last year’s Christmas gift from my wonderful wife — and I can quite<br>
honestly say that it’s completely changed the way I read.</p>

<p>I’ve always been a keen reader, but sometimes found it difficult to find time<br>
to read while also having a book available. I also tended only to buy books one<br>
at a time when I was in a physical bookshop. As a consequence, most of my<br>
reading happened at home, either in bed or in the bath, and I would get through<br>
books at around one a month.</p>

<p>Since getting my Kindle (well, since first getting the Kindle app for iPhone 14<br>
months ago) I have read 45 books. I never used to read non-fiction books, but<br>
have just finished my third of the last few months. My decision on what to read<br>
next would generally wait until I’d finished my last book, but now I have 14<br>
books waiting to be read and about another 20 on an Amazon wishlist waiting to<br>
be purchased.</p>

<p>What’s caused this change? As you might guess, it’s a combination of several<br>
things. Compared to a paper book, my Kindle weighs almost nothing, so I can<br>
slip it in a bag or a pocket. I can hold it in one hand while drinking tea, or<br>
lie on my back and read, both of which I found too tiring to do with paper<br>
books.</p>

<p>I also have iPhone and desktop Kindle apps, which are always in sync. I always<br>
have my current book with me, so I have many more opportunities to read.</p>

<p>When I finish a book, I can immediately start the next, whether I have one<br>
already lined up or I need to go online and buy one. I’ve basically turned into<br>
a chain-reader, going from book to book without pause.</p>

<p>Irritatingly, the prices do not reflect the near-zero marginal cost of<br>
distributing digital content — if you shift content in the volume that Amazon<br>
can, your income is almost pure profit.</p>

<p>However, digital books are still cheaper than the print editions. The<br>
difference for popular fiction is pretty small, but I appreciate it<br>
nonetheless. For specialist non-fiction, on the other hand, where low volumes<br>
make print copies prohibitively expensive, digital editions come at a<br>
significant discount — often half price or better in my experience.</p>

<p>I actually wrote the entire first draft of this post without mentioning either<br>
screen quality or battery life. Both are so good that it didn’t even occur to<br>
me to mention them.</p>

<p>There are downsides too. Because I’m locked into Amazon’s infrastructure, I<br>
can’t lend books to friends or family (this feature <em>still</em> hasn’t been enabled<br>
outside the US). I also can’t donate books to charity shops once I’ve finished<br>
them.</p>

<p>Both of these facts still make me uneasy, and I’m not sure that I want all my<br>
books to be controlled by a single company for the rest of my life. And I<br>
haven’t even started on the problem of how many books I need to read on Kindle<br>
to break even on the carbon footprint, or even whether that’s possible.</p>

<p>That said, my pragmatic side is winning at the moment. Reading on Kindle just<br>
works, and it seems to suit my lifestyle much better than books made of dead<br>
tree.</p>

<p>I know a lot of people have been given Kindles this Christmas, so I’d love to<br>
know if any of my readers have thoughts on this.</p>
