<p><em>This blog post is part of my contribution to the open online course<br>
<a href="http://openeducation.us/">Introduction to Openness in Education</a>.</em></p>

<p>Ok, so the last post was a bit long. Like essay long. I started writing and<br>
then I kept on writing til I’d got it all out. I’m pretty happy with the<br>
content, but it took too long to write and it takes too long to read.</p>

<p>So here’s my pithy(ish) introduction to Open Source.</p>

<p>‘Open’, as you might expect, refers to the free sharing of stuff. The ‘Source’<br>
part refers to <em>source code</em>: the human-readable form in which computer<br>
software is written. So we’re talking about software distributed in<br>
human-modifiable form, not the compiled, click-to-run executable most people<br>
are used to.</p>

<p>There are two key arguments in favour of Open Source: the moral one and the<br>
economic one.</p>

<p>The moral argument goes like this. In the beginning only a few dedicated<br>
hackers had computers. They put their craft first, worked together well and<br>
shared their developments with each other. They were able to learn from and<br>
build on each other’s code, and everyone was happy.</p>

<p>As the computer industry grew, the business types who started up companies to<br>
exploit new developments realised that they could make money by keeping the<br>
source code secret and only releasing the executable code to customers. So they<br>
made non-free software the norm and the world a poorer place for it.</p>

<p>But there are many people who feel this is naive and unrealistic. To convince<br>
them, you also need the economic argument.</p>

<p>Conventional wisdom has it that if you try to build software with a team that’s<br>
too large, you get bogged down in communication between team-members and the<br>
whole enterprise becomes unmanageable.</p>

<p>This is fairly accurate for closed-source software: the nature of commercial<br>
companies is that everything has to be managed in a certain way and everyone<br>
has to be in communication with everyone else.</p>

<p>Mathematicians may recognise this as a complete graph — in which every node in<br>
connected to every other node — and the problem is that the number of links<br>
grows much quicker than the number of people.</p>

<p>Open source projects, like Linux, involve huge numbers of people, so on paper<br>
they shouldn’t work. But on a large open source project, most people contribute<br>
only to a small part of the whole, only communicating with a few others. Only a<br>
small number, by dint of personality type or happenstance, coordinate with many<br>
others to keep the whole thing together.</p>

<p>And because these projects don’t suffer from the communication difficulties,<br>
they can capitalise on the much larger group of minds working on a problem.</p>

<p>Thanks to this effect, hobbyist programmers really can built high quality<br>
software and that’s why OS projects Linux and Apache dominate the modern web<br>
between them.</p>

<p>But why should we use open source software?</p>

<p>As Cory Doctorow points out in his recent talk “The coming war on general<br>
computation”, the computer is fully general: there’s no program that they can’t<br>
in theory run.</p>

<p>That scares a lot of people: it means you can run whatever you like, even<br>
software that (shock horror!) makes it possible to break the law. So should<br>
governments or corporations be restricting what we can run?</p>

<p>Cars can be used to commit crime, but only a police state would try to restrict<br>
where you can drive to, or insist on low-jacking each one. Open source software<br>
is controlled by the community, and so is naturally resistant this type of<br>
centralised control — you may not agree but I think that’s worth defending.</p>

<p>And as Benjamin Franklin once wrote, “Those who would give up Essential Liberty<br>
to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.”</p>
