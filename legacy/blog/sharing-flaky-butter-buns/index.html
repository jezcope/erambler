<p>You know you’ve made it on the web when you’re asked to take something down.</p>

<h2 id="the-story">The story</h2>

<p>For Christmas I received, amongst other lovely presents, a copy of Dan Lepard’s<br>
book <em>The Handmade Loaf</em>. I really enjoy breadmaking, with all of the processes<br>
and the minor biological miracle that turns flour and water into a cohesive<br>
loaf.</p>

<p>Since then I’ve been trying out at least one, sometimes several, recipes from<br>
the book each weekend. Two weeks ago I made flaky butter buns, posting a photo<br>
of the result (delicious) on Twitter and Google+.</p>

<p>I was asked for the recipe, but as a) I’m fairly conscientious and b) I’ve been<br>
learning a lot about copyright recently this raised a question: is it a breach<br>
of copyright to share someone else’s recipe.</p>

<p>A couple of online conversations and one <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2006/mar/24/foodanddrink.uk">Guardian<br>
article</a><br>
later, I had my answer: recipes are not protected by copyright under either UK<br>
or US law. A recipe is an idea, not the expression of an idea, and is therefore<br>
not copyrightable.</p>

<p>A recipe may be covered by a patent or trade secret, but for a patent to be<br>
granted it would have to differ significantly from any other previous recipe<br>
and, having been published in a book, it clearly cannot be a trade secret.</p>

<p>So conscience satisfied, I went ahead and posted the <a href="http://posterous.erambler.co.uk/flaky-butter-buns-recipe">recipe for flaky butter<br>
buns</a> on my other blog.</p>

<p>Rather than use Lepard’s own words, which would have infringed copyright, I<br>
wrote it in my own style, which tends to skip over steps — you either need to<br>
have some baking knowledge or take the hint and buy the book. I also raved (as<br>
I have done before) about the book itself, including an Amazon link so that<br>
readers could go ahead and buy it for themselves.</p>

<p>I felt in doing so that I behaved appropriately both legally and morally, and<br>
thought no more about it.</p>

<p>Several days later, I got an email notifying my of a comment on the post (this<br>
rarely happens). As it turns out, this comment was from a member of Lepard’s<br>
team accusing me of infringing his copyright.</p>

<p>Now as I’ve said, I don’t believe that I did infringe copyright (if you’re a<br>
lawyer, I’d love to hear a legal opinion on this), but since I respect Lepard<br>
as a professional and small businessman I chose to respect his wishes (or at<br>
least those of his employee) and remove the recipe anyway.</p>

<h2 id="the-point">The point</h2>

<p>In the end this isn’t a question about the law. It’s about whether sharing (and<br>
letting other people share) your stuff is a good idea or not.</p>

<p>Even the most cursory Google search for recipe titles suggests that, should I<br>
want to, I could recreate the entire collection for free. But one of the<br>
reasons I like this book is that it’s more than a collection of recipes. It’s a<br>
well crafted book <em>about bread</em>. In addition to the recipes it contains both<br>
photographs (by the author) and descriptions of encounters with bakers around<br>
the world.</p>

<p>Yes, you can get most if not all of those recipes for free online and not have<br>
to pay a penny, but anyone who’s going to do that was never going to buy the<br>
book in the first place. In fact you could get the whole experience of the book<br>
for free, <a href="http://nationallibrariesday.org.uk/">just by going down to your local<br>
library</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I like to think that a few of my friends might have been<br>
motivated to buy their own copy of the book on the basis of my recommendation —<br>
word of mouth being the best form of advertising and free to boot.</p>

<p>So now there is no recipe, and no endorsement, and no link to buy the book on<br>
Amazon. I’ll probably think twice before recommending the book in the future<br>
(wait, didn’t I just do that again three paragraphs ago?).</p>

<p>I’d be kidding myself if I thought this will make the slightest difference to<br>
the book’s sales, but you have to wonder: if you have a book to sell, is it<br>
worth paying someone to spend time trawling the internet (which is a pretty big<br>
place) just to ensure your book is the only place the contents can be found?</p>

<p>People will still send recipes by email, or photocopy them, or pass them on by<br>
word of mouth. They will clip them out of the paper, note them down in<br>
notebooks and then post the clippings to loved ones.</p>

<p>This has always happened and always will, and though some instances are covered<br>
by copyright law, it’s completely unenforcible in such cases.</p>

<p>The internet makes this sharing more visible, but it presents an opportunity<br>
too. The classic example is YouTube: increasingly rights owners are taking the<br>
option to place ads around potentially infringing videos rather than blindly<br>
demand takedowns.</p>

<p>By the way, Martin Weller’s made his whole book, <a href="http://www.bloomsburyacademic.com/view/DigitalScholar_9781849666275/book-ba-9781849666275.xml">The Digital<br>
Scholar</a><br>
available online for free, and some mugs (me included) still seem to be paying<br>
for it. Perhaps we’re all just idiots.</p>

<p>All I really want to say is this: if you have a book to sell (or any other<br>
creative work), consider carefully the pros and cons of permitting parts to be<br>
shared freely.</p>

<p>Policing takes time and time is money, and even if the pros and cons balance<br>
out all you’re doing is spending that money to achieve zero result. Perhaps<br>
that time would be better spent engaging with your readers in positive ways.</p>
