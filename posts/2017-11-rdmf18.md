!!! intro ""
    Monday 20 and Tuesday 21 November 2017 I'm at the [Research Data Management Forum](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/research-data-management-forum-rdmf/rdmf18) in Manchester. I thought I'd use this as an opportunity to try liveblogging, so during the event some notes should appear in the box below (you may have to manually refresh your browser tab periodically to get the latest version).
    
    I've not done this before, so if the blog stops updating then it's probably because I've stopped updating it to focus on the conference instead!

    This was made possible using GitHub's cool [Gist](https://gist.github.com) tool.
