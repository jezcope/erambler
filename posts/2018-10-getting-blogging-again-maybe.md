It seems like ages since I've posted on here. That's probably because it is: my [last post was on 6 February](/extending-python-rust-1/). I'll be starting a new job soon, which will give me a lot of new food for thought and also, crucially, a shorter commute so it's possible that I'll have a bit more to write about and a bit more time in which to write it.

I won't tempt fate by saying something like "I'll be writing a lot more from now on" but I'm going to try and get back into the groove. While I'm working that out, expect short posts, more searching around for themes to write about and probably an increase in general gibberish[^1]!
