I wrote the following text on my tablet with a stylus, which was an

I'm surprised how well it worked! Here's a sample of the original text:

And here's the result of converting that to text with the built-in
handwriting recognition in Samsung Notes:

It's pretty good! It did require a fair bit of editing though, and I
reckon we can do better with a model that's properly trained on a large
enough sample of my own handwriting.
