I've updated my blog theme to use the quasi-proportional fonts Iosevka Aile and Iosevka Etoile. I really like the aesthetic, as they *look* like fixed-width console fonts (I use the true fixed-width version of Iosevka in my terminal and text editor) but they're actually proportional which makes them easier to read.
