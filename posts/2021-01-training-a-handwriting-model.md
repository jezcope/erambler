If I'm going to train an algorithm to read my weird & awful writing, I'm
going to need a decent-sized training set to work with. And since one of
the main things I want to do with it is to blog "by hand" it makes sense
to focus on that type of material for training. In other words, I need
to write out a bunch of blog posts on paper, scan them and transcribe
them as [ground truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_truth). The
added bonus of this plan is that after transcribing, I also end up with
some digital text I can use as an actual post — multitasking!

So, by the time you read this, I will have already run it through a
manual transcription process using
[Transkribus](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/) to add it to my training
set, and copy-pasted it into emacs for posting. This is a fun little
project because it means I can:

-   Write more by hand with one of my several nice fountain pens, which
    I enjoy
-   Learn more about the operational process some of my colleagues go
    through when digitising manuscripts
-   Learn more about the underlying technology & maths, and how to tune
    the process
-   Produce more lovely content! For you to read! Yay!
-   Write in a way that forces me to put off editing until after a first
    draft is done and focus more on getting the whole of what I want to
    say down.

That's it for now — I'll keep you posted as the project unfolds.

# Addendum

Tee hee! I'm actually just enjoying the process of writing stuff by hand
in long-form prose. It'll be interesting to see how the accuracy turns
out and if I need to be more careful about neatness. Will it be better
or worse than the big but generic models used by Samsung Notes or
OneNote. Maybe I should include some stylus-written text for comparison.
