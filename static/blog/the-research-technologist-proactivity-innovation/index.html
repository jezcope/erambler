<p><em>I began writing this a couple of months ago, shortly after <a href="http://www.alt.ac.uk/events/alt-c-2011">ALT-C</a>, the<br>
Association of Learning Technology Conference. Then it turned into “one of<br>
those posts” that I had to perfect before I could publish it. And that’s silly,<br>
so I’m going to publish it now and continue it in further posts, because this<br>
is a blog, not a thesis.</em></p>

<p>Anyway, as is often the case at conferences when you meet a lot of people, I<br>
kept having to answer the question “What do you do?”. My actual job title is<br>
“ICT Project Manager”, which while impressive sounding doesn’t go any way to<br>
explain what I do. In the end, I came up with the following stock response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m a research technologist: I have a very similar role to learning<br>
technologists, except that I support academics as researchers instead of<br>
as teachers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a few roles out there which sound similar, or which have similar<br>
names, so I thought I’d mention a few things that set this role apart from<br>
other similar sounding jobs. This post is the first part of a series exploring<br>
those aspects.</p>

<h2 id="first-a-disclaimer">First, a disclaimer</h2>

<p>I’m not foolish enough to think I’m the only person doing this type of job, or<br>
to pick out these features as important, or even to come up with that name. I’m<br>
quite certain there are people doing this in IT departments, in research<br>
development departments, certainly in academic departments and quite possibly<br>
in e-learning departments too. It’s more that there seems to be no standard<br>
position for this role (except where institutions have dedicated e-research<br>
teams) and I’m setting out to find other people in similar roles to share ideas<br>
with.</p>

<h2 id="proactivity-and-innovation">Proactivity and innovation</h2>

<p>Although part of my role is to support existing systems and respond to queries<br>
from users, that’s not the whole of it. I feel it’s important to keep abreast<br>
of the latest technology innovations and explore how they can be used to<br>
support research. This contrasts with the typical approach of central<br>
university IT services, which generally have a core set of “supported” software<br>
and services with rigorous procedures and checks in place to control changes to<br>
that set.</p>

<p>I don’t wish to suggest that this centralised model is inappropriate: on the<br>
contrary it’s absolutely necessary. University IT services have the very<br>
challenging job of providing an acceptable and consistent standard of service<br>
to a huge and diverse user base. To do this efficiently it’s necessary to make<br>
sure that all IT staff have a reasonable understanding of <em>every</em> supported<br>
service, which just can’t happen if that set of services is too large.</p>

<p>The trouble is that as well as providing users with a very stable, high level<br>
of support for essential services (networking, email, payroll and so on), it<br>
also tends to stifle innovation. If a new service is to be offered, a lot of<br>
time and resources must be invested in doing so at the level of existing<br>
services; quite a risk if there’s no guarantee that the new service will<br>
succeed. That means that there’s no scope to start something small, with the<br>
option of either growing it organically if it takes off or letting it die<br>
peacefully if it’s not right.</p>

<hr>

<p>I’ll be exploring this further soon, but for now I’d be interested in your<br>
take, especially if you disagree or recognise some of what I say in your own<br>
role.</p>
